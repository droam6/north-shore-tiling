## 19. ADDITIONAL NOTES

### Technical architecture (decision D01)

The site is built as plain static HTML — no build step, no framework, no JavaScript dependencies beyond AOS (scroll animations). 65+ HTML files, one CSS file (2,885 lines), one JS file (form validation, 357 lines). This was chosen over Next.js because the site is a brochure/lead-gen site with zero dynamic content. Deploys anywhere.

### Key architectural decisions

- **Static HTML over Next.js** (D01) — zero build, zero runtime
- **51 suburb pages** (D02) — 17 suburbs x 3 services for local SEO dominance
- **Service-specific email routing** (D03) — different team members handle different trades
- **Removals via external partner** (D04) — listed in nav/schema but no dedicated pages
- **Honeypot + timestamp over CAPTCHA** (D08) — zero-friction spam prevention
- **Inline CSS on landing pages** (D07) — eliminates render-blocking request for ad pages
- **Editorial design system v2** (D18) — DM Serif Display + DM Sans, warm gold, cream backgrounds
- **Blog removed** (D19) — deactivated pre-launch, files retained for future use

### Removals partner

Removals is handled by an external business at northshoreremovals.com. NSP links to them from navigation, hero slideshow, and footer. They also have their own Instagram (@northshoreremovals). NSP does not build or maintain the removals website.

### Form dataLayer events

All form submissions push to Google Tag Manager dataLayer:
```javascript
{event: 'form_submission', service: 'tiling', source: 'organic'}
```

### What "complete" looks like for launch

1. Form backend live and routing to correct service email
2. Real ABN replacing placeholder
3. Real Google review data replacing placeholder (or remove aggregateRating from schema)
4. Privacy policy and terms pages created
5. Favicon and apple-touch-icon added
6. GTM container configured
7. Sitemap submitted to Google Search Console
8. Google Maps embed on contact page
9. All hero/OG images hosted locally (replace Unsplash URLs)
